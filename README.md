# Support Vector Regression for Salary Prediction

## Description
This project demonstrates the application of Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict salaries based on position levels using the `Position_Salaries.csv` dataset. The model is trained using SVR with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and the results are visualized to show the fit of the model.
